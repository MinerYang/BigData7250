About NLineInputFormat
----------------------
With this functionality, I specify 3 lines should go to a mapper.
The input file has 6 lines, and I set number of lines per mapper to 3, then I have 2 mappers (show in screenshot1)

About SequenceFileInputFormat
-----------------------------
I first use a SequenceFileOutputFormat to create a SequenceFile to my hdfs, Then set the setInputFormatClass into SequenceFileInputFormat as usual.

About FixedLengthInputFormat
----------------------------
I import more dependencies in order to use it. org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FixedLengthInputFormat;

About CombineFileInputFormat
---------------------------
It is an abstract class. We can either implement our own one or use CombineTextInputFormat

org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input. CombineTextInputFormat;

About TextInputFormat

Just use it as usual.
